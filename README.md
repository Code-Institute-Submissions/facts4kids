# Facts for Kids
###### Code Institute / Interactive Frontend Development

This single page site project started with a thought of love to travel the world, that not merely limited to an adult, but also to the children. The design of the site is mainly for kids where they can discover the facts of each of the country, and also the famous landmarks that located on this planet.

I decided to get the most updated country list in year 2020 from [WorldOMeter](https://www.worldometers.info/geography/how-many-countries-are-there-in-the-world/), as well as the population and the Land Area data to each of the country. This organization is run by an international team of developers, researchers, and volunteers with the goal of making world statistics available to a wide audience around the world. 

As the site provided by WorldOMeter is more to statistics analysis, I have also gather the other useful data from:
- [Countryflags.com](https://www.countryflags.com/en/image-overview/) - Specialized in Country flags, that offers visitors free information about all flags of the world.
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) - Wikipedia is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia project, that provides useful information, such as: Capital, official languages, currency and time zone to support the site.
- [List of National Mottos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_mottos) - Wikipedia provides state and national mottos for the world's nations.
- [Kids-world-travel-guide.com](https://www.kids-world-travel-guide.com/) - This site owned and managed by Regina Graeff and a team of young writers, student travellers, curious explorers and students, that I have gathered the information of continents and landmarks from here.

I wanted to make this site in more interactive with full of travel information. Thus, all the data and information from the site is not from the mapping of API, but from the sites that mentioned above. This is due to none of the site that I could mapping the API and give such a rich information that the young explorer might curious to. While Google Map is used to achieve the goal of this project.

The deployed website: **[Facts4Kids](https://kongteckmee.github.io/facts4kids/)**
